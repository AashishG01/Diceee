# Diceee
Dicee is a simple two-player dice game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each time you refresh the page, both players "roll" a die, and the game displays the winner or declares a draw if the results are the same. This project was built as a fun exercise to learn JavaScript basics, especially random number generation and DOM manipulation.
