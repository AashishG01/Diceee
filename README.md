Dicee 🎲
A simple web-based dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created while learning JavaScript basics, focusing on random number generation and DOM manipulation.

📜 Description
Dicee is a fun dice game where two players "roll" dice each time the page is refreshed, with one of the players declared as the winner or a "Draw" if both dice have the same value.

🔧 Technologies Used
HTML: Structuring the game layout.
CSS: Styling with custom fonts and colors.
JavaScript: Logic for random dice roll generation and winner display.
🎲 How It Works
Each player has a dice image that updates randomly on every page refresh.
JavaScript generates random numbers to simulate the dice rolls.
Based on the roll results, the header text displays the winner or a "Draw."
